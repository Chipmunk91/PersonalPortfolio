Micro-Animations & Scroll-Triggers to guide eyes and increase dwell time

Social Proof Strip (logos of clients, partners, or “As featured in…” badges)

Exit-Intent Email Capture to download a one-pager or “The 5 Things Everyone Gets Wrong About AI Visualizations”

2. Projects
2-1. Live Playground
Embedded Sandboxes (Replit, CodeSandbox) so visitors can tweak and run demos in-page

— Calendar widget (Calendly or Google Calendar) for instant bookings

Live Chat / AI Assistant
— Quick answers to “What can you build?” or “Show me an example”

Social & Code Links (LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub) with unified icon bar

5. Global & Technical Extras
Responsive & PWA-Ready
— Mobile-first design, service-worker for offline blog reading

6. Suggested Architecture
Framework: Next.js (SSG for blog, ISR for projects), Tailwind CSS for rapid styling

Hosting: Vercel or Replit Deploy (auto-deploy on git push)

CMS: Headless CMS (Contentful/Strapi) or MDX-powered Git repo for full control

Data & Search: Algolia or Lunr.js for instant project/blog search

CI/CD: GitHub Actions → tests → deploy; Lighthouse audits on each PR
